# Algorithmic systems

Algorithmic systems are more complex in nature, since the proper formatting and presentation of a numeric quantity is 
based on some algorithm or set of rules. Examples are Chinese numerals, Hebrew numerals, or Roman numerals. 

The following table shows the number `123` represented in various locales.

| Locale | Formatted |
